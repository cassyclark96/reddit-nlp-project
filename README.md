## Objective

The objective for this project was to choose two different subreddits and use the [Pushshift API](#https://github.com/pushshift/api) to collect posts from the two subreddits and use NLP to create a model that would predict which subreddit posts came from.

## Data

The subreddits I chose were [Shower Thoughts](#https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/) and [Today I Learned](#https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/)
